|Where's My Water level creator instrucion of use|
--------------------------------------------------

*ALL THE STEP:*

1. Find Where's my water apk file from trusted source, best option is to
buy on Play store then pull it out
2. Decompile the apk
3. Use WMW level creator and get creative
4. When you're done, head over File -> Export XML
    (output file should looks like example.xml)
    then go to <decompiled apk folder>/assets/Level/
    and REPLACE any pair of png,xml level you want with yours.
    Your level will appear corresponding to the replaced one in the game.
    For example replacing first_dig.png and first_dig.xml will have your
    creation in level 1-1
5. Recopile, sign, install and share with friends(if you happen to have those)



1. For the level to load in the game, there are TWO things for it to work:
the Map layout PNG file, and the Object mapping XML file
    To imagine what's that looks like, view 'mapExample.png'
    WMW level creator will work on rendering that XML, but you have to draw
the map (in Paint, Photoshop, GIMP,...) yourself
    The PNG MUST have the following attribute:
        -Index colored
        -90x120 resolution
        -8 bits/pixel (bitdepth)
        -non-interlaced
    The PNG holds the following stuff in the game:
        -Rock (GRAY)
        -Rock layers (for styling only) (3 shades of GRAY)
        -Water (BLUE)
        -Poison (PURPLE)
        -Ooze (ORANGE)
        -Air (DARK BLUE)
        -Dirt (BROWN)
        -Mud (DARK BROWN)
        -Algea (GREEN)
        -Boiling thingy (turn water to air) (RED)
        -Spike (popping baloons) (
        
2. After that, you'll have a nice background where you can put other
