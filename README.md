# WmwXmlLevelCreator

A proof of concept program for making your own level in the once popular mobile puzzle game Where's My Water

I made this like 3 years ago as a really cool summer project and it had been living in my google drive since

To use this program, run ```python ./mapmaker.py```
For instructions, view ```help.txt```
